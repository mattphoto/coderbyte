This is literally awesome. I'm in awe
it's a tremendous amount of time and effort that is being offered for free.

why do you need another free resource on free resources? There are almost too many resources out there over vastly varying quality to wade through. Having an opinionated path through those resources, even if you disagree with it, is of great value. It's the same reason newspapers have editors who decide for you what story ought to be on the front page, what should be on the second and what should be in the back with all the ads. It's the difference between finding new york times on your doorstep vs. individual clippings of each article strewn over your lawn for you to figure out what to read.
